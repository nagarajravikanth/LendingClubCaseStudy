# Lending Club Case Study

Lending to 'high-risk' borrowers represents the largest cause of financial loss for lenders, commonly referred to as credit loss. Credit loss occurs when the borrower fails to repay or absconds with the borrowed funds.

The primary goal is to identify these high-risk applicants, allowing the company to reduce the number of such loans and thereby minimize credit loss. This case study focuses on using exploratory data analysis (EDA) to detect these applicants.

The analysis aims to uncover the key factors, or driver variables, that contribute to loan defaults, identifying the strongest indicators of risk. This information can be leveraged by the company to improve portfolio management and assess risk more effectively.
